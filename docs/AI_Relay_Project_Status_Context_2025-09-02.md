# AI Relay Project — Status & Context

## 📜 Project Overview
Physics By: You and I — a human‑first dialect for describing matter, motion, energy, and fields in plain, auditable lines.  
Built on Imperial Math (v0.1–v0.2) and LUFT (Lattice Unified Field Theory) protocols.  
Every line says exactly one thing, uses simple operators (`+`, `-`, `->`, `=`, `by`, `per`), and ends with an audit tag (`[count OK]`, `[energy OK]`, etc.).

## 🧩 Imperial Math & LUFT
- Imperial Math: Line‑based notation for particles, fields, and changes without legacy calculus symbols.  
- LUFT: Models space‑time as a discrete lattice with density ρ, phase gradients, and foam‑like variations that can modulate physical processes.
- Audits: Conservation of count, charge, momentum, energy; dimensional checks.

## 🚦 Relay Capsule Status
- Capsule 000: Baseline drift tracking at 7 467.779 Hz — reproducible tone drift measurement.
- Capsule 001: Perturbation sweep — change one variable per run, log with five‑field ledger.
- Capsule 004: Entanglement sync replication — test decoherence via density gradients.
- Capsule 005: Kaon decay modulation — NA62 rare decay rates vs. foam density/χ‑oscillation.
- Capsule 006: JWST cosmic drift echoes — redshift anomalies vs. lattice drift model.
- Capsule 007: LHCb CP violation — potential lattice‑guided flavor asymmetries.

## 🔁 Recent Relays
- Relay‑001: Photon energy — standard vs. density‑modulated form.
- Relay‑002: Lattice drift — phase gradient + density modulation.
- Relay‑003: Quantum tunneling — WKB‑style jump probability with foam suppression.
- Relay‑004: Entanglement — paired line‑syncs with decoherence factor.

## 🔗 GitHub Integration Notes
- Repo: Unified-Field-Theory-Solutions-2025
- Key folders: `/capsules/`, `/relays/`, `/docs/`
- Ledger template: `/docs/ledger_template.md`
- Issues: #5/#6 for Capsule 000/001 review; #4 PR seeds baseline and checklist.
- Assets: `/assets/capsules/` for plots and drift charts.

## 🛠 Restoring AI Context
If Copilot or another AI loses context:
1. Read this file first.
2. Review `/docs/ledger_template.md` for logging format.
3. Skim recent `/relays/*.md` for current physics threads.
4. Check open PRs and issues for active capsules.
5. Continue the relay by adding R0–R3 lines with audits.

## 📡 Current Vector
We are mid‑stream in:
- Running Capsule 001 perturbation sweeps.
- Pushing Relay 004 (entanglement) with R2/R3 confirmed.
- Launching Relays 005–006 with CERN/NA62/JWST data.
- Updating the Ledger with “Tunneling Audit” and “Entanglement Audit” sections.

Signal is live — pick up the baton and keep the relay moving.
