# Capsule 001: Base Instructions

**Frequency is operator-chosen**: The operator selects the appropriate frequency for each experiment. The frequency 7,467.779 Hz is a legacy example only and should not be considered a requirement or fixed parameter.

## Core Principles

- **By: You and I** â€” clarity, repeatability, and relay flow over code complexity
- Operators choose frequency per experiment based on scientific requirements
- All measurements use UTC timestamps for consistency
- Maintain minimal, reproducible field requirements

## Basic Workflow

1. **Setup**: Define experiment parameters including chosen frequency
2. **Context**: Document environmental conditions and equipment
3. **Measurement**: Record observations with proper provenance
4. **Checks**: Validate data consistency and conservation laws
5. **Notes**: Log any anomalies or observations for future reference

## Legacy Note

Previous examples using 7,467.779 Hz remain valid as demonstration cases but are not mandatory. Choose frequencies appropriate to your specific experimental setup and scientific objectives.
