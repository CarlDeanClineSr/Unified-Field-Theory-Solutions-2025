# Contributing and Reviews (Repo 13)

Review paths
- Issues: Open a "Review request" issue and link the file(s) to review.
- Pull Requests: Submit edits; the PR template guides scope and questions.

Style for text capsules
- One idea per line when possible; add [audit â€¦] at line ends for checks (charge/momentum/energy/stats).
- Separate prediction vs. record; use "measure -> record" wording to teach as we go.

Analysis helpers
- scripts/radio_lattice_fft.py scans for peaks (e.g., 7,467.779 Hz, ~7,468.3 Hz).
- Keep dependencies minimal; see requirements.txt.

Ground rules
- Be concrete, cite data when available, keep teaching at the line level.
- No heavy formatting required; clarity over ornament.
