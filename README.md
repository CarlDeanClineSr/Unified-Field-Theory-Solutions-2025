# Unified-Field-Theory-Solutions-2025
The real math needed to unify physics. Not some old idea from decades ago... NEW!

## Not locked to any legacy frequency
Operators choose frequency per experiment based on scientific requirements. The frequency 7,467.779 Hz is a legacy example only and should not be considered a fixed parameter or requirement.

## Cross-scale audit fit
The project uses a [unified ledger schema](docs/ledger_unified_schema.md) that scales from audio drift to particle physics and cosmology:

- **[Relay 005: NA62 Audit Fit](docs/relays/relay_005_na62_audit_fit.md)** - Ultra-rare kaon decay analysis
- **[Relay 006: JWST Audit Fit](docs/relays/relay_006_jwst_audit_fit.md)** - High-redshift galaxy mass anomalies

All audits use the same core logic: counts, balance, rates, and rare spike detection with consistent UTC timestamps and provenance tracking.
