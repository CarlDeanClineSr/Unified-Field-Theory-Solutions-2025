# Unified Field Theory Lab Charter

Purpose
- Unify the structure, dynamics, and underlying construction of space, time, energy, and matter.
- Formalize movements and couplings of energies across scales with reproducible, testable artifacts.

Scope and Pillars
- Theory development: formal models, coupling rules, invariants.
- Data pipelines: schema-first CSV/Parquet with validated contracts.
- Simulation: deterministic, reproducible runs with seeds and config snapshots.
- Validation and audit: NA62-style harnesses and CI gates on PRs.
- Documentation: human-readable narratives beside machine-checked results.

Principles
- Reproducibility over performance (then optimize).
- Schema-first data; results/ is generated, not versioned.
- Safety: least-privilege workflows and explicit permissions.
- Modularity: small, composable tools with typed interfaces.

Repositories and Roles
- LUFT-Auto: automation, “SCAN MAIN” dashboards, cross-repo signals.
- Unified-Field-Theory-Solutions-2025: core methods, Relay 005 results, validation harnesses.
- Reality-based-Space-and-its-functionality: Resonance Atlas, EM-Lattice modules, extraction pipelines.

Governance
- All changes via PR with CI green: CSV schema checks, audit harnesses.
- Reviews: 1+ reviewer for model/algorithm changes; quick-follow for docs/config.
- Versioning: tag model releases; include run config hashes in result headers.

Immediate Roadmap (next 2 weeks)
- Populate Resonance Atlas from initial capsules via scripts/extract_resonance_atlas.py.
- Finalize Relay 005 pipeline and lock CSV schemas.
- Extend SCAN MAIN to capture cross-repo data freshness and CI pass rates.
- Establish data contracts for results/ with auto-regen make targets.
- Publish a short “How to Run” doc and a demo seed run.

Artifacts
- Dashboards: nightly health report from LUFT-Auto.
- Results: generated only; summarized in README badges and CI artifacts.
- Logs: retained as artifacts with seed, config, and environment metadata.

Glossary (living)
- Resonance Atlas: canonical index of resonances, couplings, and metadata.
- EM-Lattice: module family modeling electromagnetic coupling lattices.
- Relay 005: current validation relay and audit harness iteration.
