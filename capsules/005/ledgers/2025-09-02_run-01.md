# Relay 005 — NA62 Audit Fit (Seed Ledger)

Who and when:
- Carl Dean Cline Sr., 2025-09-02 12:03 UTC

Setup / Context:
- Dataset: data/templates/na62_kaon_candidates_template.csv (mini sample)
- Selection: K+→π+νν̄ candidates; simple preselection + veto pass
- Notes: counts-only, rate proxy via weight column if present

Measured:
- Counts by classification: signal=__, background=__, unknown=__
- Rate proxy: sum(weight) by bin (if weights present)
- Units: counts (dimensionless), weights (a.u.)

Checks:
- Veto/kinematics consistency spot-checks
- Reproducibility: same CSV → same counts
- Provenance: source_url filled for each row

Notes:
- What changed: [e.g., stricter veto reduced candidates by X%]
- What stayed: [e.g., background shape stable]
- Odd moments: [e.g., one high-weight outlier]
- Best guess why: [short reason]
- Next test: [e.g., add acceptance per run_id]
