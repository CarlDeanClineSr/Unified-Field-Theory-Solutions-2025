# Ledger — Relay 005 (NA62 Kaon Audit)
- Who: Carl Dean Cline Sr
- When: 2025-09-02T23:24:02Z
- Run ID: 2025-09-02_run-01
- Context:
  - Seed run with a few curated example rows; operational test of audit harness and ledger schema.
  - Baseline_br = 1.06e-10; baseline_sigma = 3.7e-11 (quick‑audit defaults; override as needed).
- Data:
  - Source: data/templates/na62_kaon_candidates_template.csv
  - Candidates: 3 (2 passed veto, 1 vetoed) — seed only; replace with real entries.
- Procedure:
  - Filter passed_veto == true.
  - Observed signal weight: sum(weight | class=signal) = 1.0 (toy)
  - Total weight (passed_veto): 2.0 (toy)
  - Observed rate (toy) = 0.5 (dimensionless fraction of passed events labeled "signal").
  - χ² vs baseline (toy) = computed by script; not physically meaningful with seed data.
- Foam Audit:
  - Δρ/ρ_avg: <enter after fit>
  - χ_mod: <enter after fit>
  - Fit method: <e.g., χ² modulation fit over phase/energy bins>
  - Windows/Bins: <e.g., π⁺ momentum window, binning scheme>
  - Notes: <freeform notes and references>
- Checks:
  - CSV schema validated (columns present).
  - Reproducible via scripts/na62_audit_fit.py
- Notes:
  - Replace sample rows with real candidate entries; this run is a lane check.
  - Next: add missing mass and π⁺ momentum window checks; develop foam‑fit routine.
