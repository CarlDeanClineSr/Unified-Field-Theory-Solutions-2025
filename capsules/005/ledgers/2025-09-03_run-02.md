- Who: Carl Dean Cline Sr
- When: 2025-09-03T00:00:00Z
- Run ID: 2025-09-03_run-02
- Context:
  - Run‑02 begins real‑data curation using NA62 public candidates (target 30–51 events).
  - Baseline_br = 1.06e-10; baseline_sigma = 3.7e-11 (override via env as needed).
- Data:
  - Source: data/na62/curated_candidates.csv
  - Candidates: <to be filled after curation>
- Procedure:
  - Filter passed_veto == true.
  - Observed signal weight: sum(weight | class=signal) = <tbd>
  - Total weight (passed_veto): <tbd>
  - Observed rate (toy) = <tbd>
  - χ² vs baseline (toy) = <tbd>
- Foam Audit:
  - Δρ/ρ_avg: <enter after fit>
  - χ_mod: <enter after fit>
  - Fit method: <e.g., χ² modulation fit over phase/energy bins>
  - Windows/Bins: <e.g., π⁺ momentum window, binning scheme>
  - Notes: <freeform notes and references>
- Checks:
  - CSV schema validated; curated rows reviewed.
  - Reproducible via scripts/na62_audit_fit.py
- Notes:
  - Paste the audit summary block here after running scripts/na62_audit_fit.py locally.
