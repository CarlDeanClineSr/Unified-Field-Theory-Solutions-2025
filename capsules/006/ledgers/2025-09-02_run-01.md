# Relay 006 — JWST Audit Fit (Seed Ledger)

Who and when:
- Carl Dean Cline Sr., 2025-09-02 12:03 UTC

Setup / Context:
- Dataset: data/templates/jwst_galaxies_template.csv (mini sample)
- Selection: high-z candidates; include z, logM*, field, survey
- Notes: counts vs. simple z bins; deviations flagged qualitatively

Measured:
- Counts per z-bin: z∈[a,b): N=__ (list a few bins you plan to use)
- Optional mass slices: logM* bins with counts
- Units: counts (dimensionless)

Checks:
- Provenance: source_url set for each galaxy
- Consistency: duplicates removed; z within selection window
- Reproducibility: same CSV → same counts

Notes:
- What changed: [e.g., extra candidates in highest z-bin]
- What stayed: [e.g., mid-z counts stable]
- Odd moments: [e.g., one extreme mass entry]
- Best guess why: [short reason]
- Next test: [e.g., compare against baseline binning]
